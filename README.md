# HackBio_Genomics_Workshop
This repository contains tasks executed during HackBio's Genomics Workshop {2022}


## WEEK 1 (Stage Zero)
This focused on  introducing BASh and performing basic tasks in BASh. The tasks weere:
1. Write a simple Bash program where your first name and last name are assigned to different variables,  and the script prints out your full name
2. Write a version where the strings are printed on the same line and a version where the strings are printed on different lines
3. Completing 2 stories using pre-designed notebooks
You can find my codes in stage0.sh


## WEEK 2 (Stage One)
The week's were focused on:
1. Using BASh commands to process biological data
2. Learning to use some softwares
I worked on 3 datasets and chose to use FASTQC,FASTP, AND MULTIQC for the task. You an find my codes in Stage1.sh


## WEEK 3 (Stage 2)
This week's theme was "Standing on the shoulders of giants". This week featured a live coding assessment in addition to the week's task.
For the assessment, the task was to perform mapping on some datasets using Bowtie2 (to generate a .sam file). Please find my codes in livetest.sh.
